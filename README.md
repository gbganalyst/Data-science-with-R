# Data science with R

Being a passionate person that wants everyone to become a data scientist, also with the love of spreading the good stuff that R programming can do, I initiated an R training session for the staff of Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) in Rwanda. This continuous training session will allow them to work with R and do all kinds of data wrangling and data visualization. All thanks to Hadley Wickham the Chief data scientist at R studio for his book **R for data science** and Suzan Baert who taught me [dplyr package](https://suzan.rbind.io/categories/tutorial/)
