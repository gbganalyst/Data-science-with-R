# Data-science-with-R
With the passion to make everyone becoming a data scientist and with the love of spreading the good stuffs that R programming can do, I initiated an R training session for the staff of Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) in Rwanda. This continuous training session will allow them to work with R and do all kinds of data wrangling and data visualization. All thanks to Hadley Wickham, the Chief data scientist at R studio for his book R for data science and Suzan Baert who taught me dplyr package at https://suzan.rbind.io/categories/tutorial/
